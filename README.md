# MTaManagementSystem

México Tierra de Amaranto, is a civil association which handles a lot of information from communities, employees, promoters, beneficiaries, and internal management data, such as inventory, supplies, amongst other things. As a growing organization, all these logs become increasingly complicated, and increasingly important. Currently, México Tierra de Amaranto is taking some records by hand, others on Excel, and keeping track of the latest version of all of these documents has become an issue. Without all of the information in one place, it has been hard for the administrative team to take informed decisions on how to manage the association.
DjangoGirl’s goal on this project is to make data collection and report gathering easier for México Tierra de Amaranto´s administration, in order to help them take better and more informed decisions for the future of the association.
